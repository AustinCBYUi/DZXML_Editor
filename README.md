# DZXML_Editor
 DZ types.xml editor
**Please read further for directions / clarification.**
### Introduction
DZXML Editor is an open-source Python developed simple types.xml modifier for DayZ server owners. I developed this
application so I didn't have to individually go through each nominal and min value on an xml ever again. Additionally
I don't like dealing with corrupted files from the web based editor.
### Documentation
The easiest way to use this tool is to run the .exe file that comes in the package. Make sure you have a types.xml file
in the same directory as the .exe or it will not run the program. The application is written in Python and compiled to the
executable for Windows using auto-py-to-exe. If your computer is any other operating system or you are skeptic you will have to:
1. Download the most recent python at `https://www.python.org/downloads/`
2. Make sure there is a types.xml file in the directory. (Should be if you just downloaded it.)
3. Double click the DZXML.py file, it will run the same way as the .exe file would.
The reason as to why I built the .exe and included the source code is for:
- Open-source software can be editted by others.
- To show the source code.
- .exe doesn't require Python to be installed as it is interpretted.
