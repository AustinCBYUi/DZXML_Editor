# DZXML_Editor
 DZ types.xml editor
**Please read further for directions / clarification.**
### Introduction
DZXML Editor is an open-source Python developed simple types.xml modifier for DayZ server owners. I developed this
application so I didn't have to individually go through each nominal and min value on an xml ever again. Additionally
I don't like dealing with corrupted files from the web based editor.
### Documentation
The easiest way to use this tool is to just make sure you have Python 3 installed
